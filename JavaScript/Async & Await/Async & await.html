            async makes a function return a Promise
            
            await makes a function wait for a Promise</h2>
        <b>Async :</b>
        ~ In Simple words async and await are used instead of (then) and callback functions
        callback-hell inorder to make the code wait to execute the  asynchronous fuctions 
        instead of executing the rest of statements
        ~ An async function declaration creates an AsyncFunction object.
        ~ Each time when an async function is called, it returns a new Promise
        which will be resolved with the value returned by the async function, or rejected with an exception uncaught within the async function.
        ~ The purpose of async/await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs. 
        ~ The behavior of async/await is similar to combining generators and promises
        <b>Await :</b>
       ~ The await keyword can only be used inside an <b>"async function."</b>
       ~ The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues:

        <b>settle means resolve or reject 
        resolve means promise setteled sucessfully
        reject  means promise ha not setteled sucessfully..
        </b>
